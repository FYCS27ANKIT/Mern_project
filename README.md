# Mern_project
Event Management System design - This is a full-stack event management web application built using the MERN stack. The system allows users to register, log in, and perform full CRUD operations on events. Authentication is handled using JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies for security. Only logged-in users can add, update, or delete their own events, while all users can view all public events. The frontend is built with React JSX and includes clean, modular components for navigation, user handling, and event management
